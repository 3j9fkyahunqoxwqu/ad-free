# ad-free

Ad Free is a research project attempting to show flaws in the way how _Spotify for Android_ presents audio advertisement. It is a proof-of-concept of a modularized Ad Blocker written in Kotlin with a modern and simplistic user interface.

## Features
- Turn off sound when advertisement is playing
- Play arbitrary audio instead of Spotify advertisement
- No ROOT required
- Plugin based design

## Implementation notes
### Ad detection
Advertisement detectors are modularized into implementations of [AdDetectable](./app/src/main/java/ch/abertschi/adump/detector/AdDetectable.kt). An instance of `AdDetectable` can determine if a track being played is a Spotify advertisement or not.

Ad Free registers an [NotificationListenerService](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/service/notification/NotificationListenerService.html) and is therefore able to parse all incoming notifications on Android. Notifications shown by Spotify are parsed by implementations of `AdDetectable`:

- `SpotifyTitleDetector`:  
Detector which parses Spotify notifications for the keyword _Spotify_. This keyword is present in most advertisements. In order to avoid false positives, an notification action is provided to unblock wrongly detected advertisements.

- `NotificationActionDetector`:  
Detector which parses Spotify notifications for properties which are only present on advertisement. This approach detects all advertisement.

### Ad blocking
[AudioManager](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioManager.html), Android's Audio System provides several streams on which audio can be played. Spotify, alike many music players, plays audio on the stream [STREAM_MUSIC](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioManager.html#STREAM_MUSIC). In case of ad detection, Ad Free mutes _STREAM MUSIC_ and calls a configured [AdPlugin](.app/src/main/java/ch/abertschi/adump/plugin/AdPlugin.kt). `AdPlugins` aim to replace Spotify's advertisement. They play music on an alternative stream are therefore not affected by the mute of _STREAM MUSIC_.

#### Plugins

Currently, an [instance](./app/src/main/java/ch/abertschi/adump/plugin/interdimcable/InterdimCablePlugin.kt) of `AdPlugin` is implemented which replaces Spotify advertisements with interdimensional cable advertisements featured in [Adult Swims's Rick and Morty TV series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESab_umifCU&list=PLNu47mcqeyiATtjW5pIRWlpXBu4pUezdP).

## Compatibility
Due to the lack of notifications on Android TV, Ad Free is currently not compatible with Android TV.
